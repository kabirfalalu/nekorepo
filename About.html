        <p>  

Neko is a digital educational training School created to empower the Global youths  through skills acquisition/training & entrepreneurship development by meeting two (2) of the Sustainable Development Goals which are Quality education & Poverty alleviation.

 

The School is given  training on Digital Technology skills, Handcraft skills, Technical skills and Entrepreneurship studies.
Such vocational courses included Baking, Soap making, Beading, Computer Appreciation, Hair Making, Shoe & Bag making, Make up & Headgear tying, Events Management & Hall decoration, Photography/Videography and Entrepreneurship classes. This training had a phenomenal impact on the community and the lasting social and economic benefits continue to reverberate till today.
We haven’t looked back since then and several training programs have been organized by GOVSA both physically and virtually (notably during the worldwide lockdown in 2020 when we organized free virtual trainings for children, youth and adults).
